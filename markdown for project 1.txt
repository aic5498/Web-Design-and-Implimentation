a interactive screen where moving your character around changes the patterns on screen in relation to your characters movment, to create kalidescope and or fractel like patterns

the movement of patterns on the screen/skybox would be controlled by the players movment. movement on the x/y plane could control parameters
in the patttern, such as complexity, smoothness, or number of diffrent generation points. the speed of the players movement could also affect the speed that the pattern cycles through
or it may be tied to s static value that the player controls. id like it to generate unique color patterns in a random way that are influenced by the player. the style would
smooth color transitions in the shapes generated by the program. inspiration is taken from fractel zoom videos.
